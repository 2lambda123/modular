# Modular 5.0.0

## New Features

- Node 20 Support. Modular is now tested against Node 20, and has added it to
  the supported engines field
- Build output now targets ES2017 (Previously ES2016)
- Standardized Modular command behavior:
  - [`modular lint`](../commands/lint.md) now fully supports selective behavior,
    taking packages instead of regexes as the default arguments, bringing it in
    line with other modular commands
  - [`modular lint`](../commands/lint.md) now runs `lint` script on selected
    non-modular packages by default, if specified in the package's
    `package.json`
  - [`modular typecheck`](../commands/typecheck.md) now runs `typecheck` script
    selected non-modular packages, if specified in the package's `package.json`
  - Modular's workspace resolver now respects a repo's `.gitignore`, overridden
    by an optional `.modularignore`. Ignored workspaces will be skipped by
    Modular commands and won't cause errors from Modular checks

## Breaking Changes

- Dropped Node 14 from supported engines in line with the end of
  [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule). Modular is no
  longer tested against Node 14 and can't guarantee compatibility
- Build output now targets ES2017 (Previously ES2016)
- Changed default behavior and options for [`modular lint`](../commands/lint.md)
  and [`modular typecheck`](../commands/typecheck.md). All functionality has
  been retained, but the command interface has been changed
- Modular's workspace resolver now respects `.gitignore`. This behavior, if
  breaking, can be overridden by adding an empty `.modularignore` to the repos's
  root.
